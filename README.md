# Site Building

The goal of this project is to have one place where I can build cool designs I find across the web and share that work.

## Sites Built

In this project, you'll find the following designs built out:

### Jobs Dashboard

This design is for a job recruiter platform that allows for the user to track their current job openings. The user can track the amount of candidates that have applied for their different job openings as well as other important information about it.

**Design:** [Click here](https://dribbble.com/shots/9523083-Job-Ad-Dashboard-Hiring-Platform)

**Implementation:** [Click here](http://localhost:3000/job-dashboard)

**Disclaimer:** This was built with resolutions greater than **900px**. The design didn't have a mobile implementation so I didn't build one. A future project idea is to design and build the mobile version of this dashboard.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
